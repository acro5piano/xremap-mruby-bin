# Why

Xremap is nice. It changed linux user's life.

Xremap was recently replaced with Rust version. It might work fine, but X11 users (like me) might prefer the previous one, because it does not require to modify linux group setting.

I tried to build [the final mruby Xremap](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap/tree/caea9a1c2fe6f0a55114dc38990dfb03de6aca4b), but I failed because of an erorr. I gave up to complete it and instead upload the binary here.

I'll use this binary when I buy a new PC.
