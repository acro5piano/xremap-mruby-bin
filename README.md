# xremap-x11-bin

executable binary of original xremap wrote in mruby

# Why

Xremap is nice. It changed linux user's life.

Xremap was recently replaced with Rust version. It might work fine, but X11 users (like me) might prefer the previous one, because it does not require to modify linux group setting.

I tried to build the mruby version of the latest commit below, but I couldn't build it because of an erorr. I gave up to build it and instead upload the binary here. I'll use this binary when I buy a new PC.
